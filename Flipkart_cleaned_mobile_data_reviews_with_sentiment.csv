Using this machine is a whole new experience. It looks like everything is up to par. The display is super fluid. Performance is decent; it has a capable SOC. Forget about whether you know 8 Gen 2 or 8 Gen 3... Nothing done with 8+ gen 1 in this machine is incredible. The software optimization is excellent.

This is a good phone but the main problem is that the Internet doesn't connect well. Good for gaming. Lag free performance. The battery charges very fast and takes less time. Camera quality is excellent. It can capture things far away with good quality. The design is not so impressive because the camera size is way too much large. It can be a bit smaller also. The display size is okay enough. Otherwise the phone is a good phone to use.

I am reviewing after a month. Which I don't like about this phone. I write on it.  1. The battery of this phone drains very fast. Even in lite use this phone survives a day.  My last phone was a Poco m2 pro and it's 4 years old . That still gives better battery experiences than this phone.  2. It heats up high while charging and normal uses.
