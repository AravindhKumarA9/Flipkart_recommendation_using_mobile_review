The real smart phone in the market..... Lets talk about it.....  Camera: In this range two best camera in the market are pixel 7 and s22.

I was pixel 4a user. Using pixel 7 for 1 day. As per me pixel 4a camera was better to do astrophotography. That was only 12.2MP. I have expected better clarity for this 50MP camera.

"Being a photographer, I've upgraded from Pixel 6a to Pixel 7. Not much big change in rear camera. Front camera is slightly better than 6a. I've attached few images that I shot using pixel 7.

"To give an overview of the features and its design I would say overall it is good. One of the major con is that the on screen fingerprint scanner doesn't work if your fingertips are dry.

"The phone itself is a masterpiece the AI makes the photos more realistic than what it shows. The stock android is already a thing that I am attracted to. So, it checks all my boxes for buying it.  The fingerprint scanner is not great as that of other phones but not as bad either the on-screen scanner is around just below the center of the screen so, it's in a weird position but overall it's ok.

Good but not up to the mark considering the product from Google.  The camera is overrated... Don't work well in low light around 6-7 PM... Clarity is good but could have been better.  The battery gets drained within 3-4 hours of continuous use.. And takes 1.5 hrs for getting fully charged with the recommended Google 30W adapter..  2 Sim support with 2nd SIM as eSIM...

"First of all, in low light, the camera is terrible. It is unable to take good pictures; the few it does take are appalling. It is possible to take good photos with a 50 megapixel camera if the lighting is really favorable. The images in 12 mp are very poor quality. In the portrait mode, excellent lighting produces high-quality images; conversely, poor lighting produces extremely low-quality images. Thus, the camera has to be greatly improved.

The best processor i have ever seen in this mobile . Performance was best and i brought only seeing the processor. If you want to store high data this phone will be the best. No lag issues.

This is a good phone but the main problem is that the Internet doesn't connect well. Good for gaming. Lag free performance. The battery charges very fast and takes less time. Camera quality is excellent. It can capture things far away with good quality. The design is not so impressive because the camera size is way too much large. It can be a bit smaller also. The display size is okay enough. Otherwise the phone is a good phone to use.

"Low light photography and indoor photography in both normal mode and portrait mode not upto the mark. Specially front camera. It disappoints. Detailings are pathetic in front camera.

This phone sometime hangs specially in camera. The camera is good in periscope lens but the image colours are sometimes not good at all. It adds too much of AI generated and sometimes gives colourless like image. Once this phone automatically shut down and it was not turning on for long time in a day.  Image clarity is good though.

"I upgraded to this from Redmi Note 4, so it is a very significant upgrade for me. Phone is fast, super responsive with no lag at all which is what you expect from a Snapdragon 8 gen 2 for Galaxy. I got 256 GB variant, so I have UFS 4.0 storage. Best camera and display, design wise looks awesome with thin and even bezels.

"The best small size phone (6.1 inch display) I have used.

Battery consumption is also very well optimised and charges at a good speed.  The only minor improvement per me could be, a slightly higher capacity battery and faster charging.

"Pros- 1. Battery is surprisingly good for a compact form factor. 2. OneUI is so well polished for this S23. And excellent software update support. 3. Camera is one of the best in the industry. 4.

"After almost 15 days of usage, Samsung S23 has lived up to my expectations. The obvious pros are its compact form factor and splendid display. During the initial few days of usage, the phone does get warm along the metal frame while multitasking or using heavy apps, but that has settled down now with continuous optimization. It still gets slightly warm but nothing too alarming. One suggestion for those users who take a lot of pictures or videos is that the 128 GB may seem to be a little short...

"Long term review, moving from apple to samsung  Battery is great for normal usage. For gamers or heavy usage, its good but wont last whole day probably. Camera is good. Gameplay(bgmi/genshin) great.

"Camera and overall features are nice. If you are into photography, can download Expert RAW app by Samsung and try to enhance your skills. Night clicks are also coming out quite good.

Review after using for a week. Pros- The phone has a great in-hand feel. Very lightweight. User interface is great. Audio quality is great.

The phone is top notch in display and design. It is round edge and compact and sleek. The in hand feel of the phone is really good owing to its design and light weight of the phone.

"Overall a good phone. It's very slim and looks good. No bloatware and has fast charging. Some downsides, the software is too simple and if you are used to other UIs which offer a lot of optimization, then this is too simple and takes time to get accustomed.

"Overall awesome phone with good performance, decent camera, cool features. Only issue is with battery and overheating. Full charge within 45 min. Nowadays summer is also in peak that's why phone heats. Overall I'm in love with this phone.  Updated review - I read most of the comments regarding battery backup and overheating. But I don't face any such issues for the same, battery last for the day and heating is there but not so much.",5,Great product,Motorola Edge 40,MOBGKHNBY3JZJHTB,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.775}",0.9906501173973083,Positive,0.2690476190476191,Positive,POSITIVE,"Highly recommend Motorola Edge 40!

"Review after one month use:  The phone is fabulous in all aspects except front camera and battery charging.  In hand feel of this phone will make you happy, the looks, design is top notch.  The performance is also remarkable in screen colur, sound and refresh rate.  The back camera is good too. The only issue is in front camera, it doesn't capture in details and the phone is heating too much while charging.

"Absolutely Perfect !! Commendable job done by Motorola. As it is the world's slimmest phone so it feels really cool in hand. It comes with curved display and with leather back panel which makes the phone too classy. Apart from this in this price segment we get all the necessary configurations so we can call it a budget friendly phone.

I am writing this review after using this phone for 1 week. 1.Camera was amazing. I will share some pix where I was super impressed with the camera performance  2.Battery back up was not that good as expected. You need to charge the phone 2 times in a day to survive whole day.  3.Performance of this phone was superb. It feels like you are using a premium phone. I will rate 5 for the performance. Yes heating was there while charging the phone or even using the phone heavily for 4- 5 hours. Bu...

This is an excellent device from Motorola. I replaced the Samsung M51 (7000mah battery) with this mobile so the battery is definitely one area of concern to me. To prevent battery drainage I am using 60hz refresh rate which is equally good to the eyes.The other small issue is the mobile gets a little heated up while charging or heavy usage. Rest all are of excellent quality and can compete with any premium Android mobile phones in the market.This feedback has been provided after 11 days of ex...
